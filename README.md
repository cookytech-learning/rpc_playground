# Cookytech RPC Playground

This project consists of our explorations in using Dart Language for our backend implementations.
RPC or remote procedure call is a communication mechanism that allows us to call functions on the 
server through `stubs`

We want to evolve a docker+grpc+protobuf+flutter based full-stack development workflow for projects we do 
from scratch.


## List of things we need to figure out

- [ ] Development
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Debugging
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Analytics
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Environment Separation
- [ ] Collaboration
- [ ] Ownership
- [ ] Deployment
- [ ] Scaling

We are hard at work building POCs one after another to make sure we have answers to all of the hard
questions for this to be a viable option for our full-stack development.

## List of Projects

We are making a number of POCs, summary and folder structure of which we index here:

### Hello GRPC
Hello GRPC is to make sure hello world is working and we have our first app built effectively, running on flutter for apps as well as web
